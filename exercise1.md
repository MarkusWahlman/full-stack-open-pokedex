The language I chose is C++. In a typical CI setup, the main steps include linting, testing, and building. For C++, the build process can be divided into two key stages: compilation and linking. A common tool used to manage and automate this process is CMake, which helps handle dependencies and platform-specific build configurations efficiently.

For testing, C++ offers several popular libraries. One widely used and quite easy to integrate framework is Catch2, which provides a simple syntax for writing unit tests. Another powerful and commonly used option is GoogleTest (gtest), which offers more extensive features and integrations for larger projects.

When it comes to linting, the C++ ecosystem includes tools like clang-tidy, which performs static code analysis and suggests modern C++ improvements, and cpplint, that checks code style according to Googleâ€™s C++ style guide. The variety of linters in C++ is smaller compared to some other languages.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other CI solutions include services such as GitLab, Azure DevOps CI/CD and CircleCI. GitLab, for example, offers similar functionality to GitHub Actions but is more tightly integrated with GitLab repositories.

Choosing between a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment depends on factors such as project size, security requirements, and maintenance capabilities. Cloud-based CI systems are often easier to manage and scale, while self-hosted solutions may be preferred when more control over infrastructure and sensitive data is required.
